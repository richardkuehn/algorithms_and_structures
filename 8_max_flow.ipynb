    "In this programming assignment, you will implement the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to solve the Maximum Flow Problem in a flow network. Using Breadth-First Search (BFS), you will iteratively find augmenting paths from a source node to a sink node and update the flow along these paths. This assignment will help you understand how residual capacities and reverse flows work in a network to maximize the total flow. You will work with a graph represented as an adjacency matrix and apply concepts such as graph traversal, pathfinding, and flow capacity adjustments. \n",
